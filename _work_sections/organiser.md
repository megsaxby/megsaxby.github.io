  - I work with collectives, cooperatives, social sector groups and organisations to help design better, more efficient and more healthy collaboration. Your group explains to me where and how you feel stuck, and then, together, we design systems and practices that work better for your goals. I aim to help you create systems that promote a culture of wellness, cooperation, creativity and resiliency in your organization.
  - My approach is somatic, collaborative and inclusiveâ€”you can read more about what that means here. In sessions, we will use body and movement-based techniques, creative discussion, arts and play, accessible group dialogue and visual tools to re-imagine and re-design the areas that are not working.
  - As an organizer, my goal is that you and your group leave with new ways to get where you are going.
