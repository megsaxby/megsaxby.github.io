    <h1>Who I am</h1>
    
  <h2>Approach</h2>
  
    <p>Philosophically and practically, I come out of the popular education movement. This means that all of my work is based on the principles of reflection and action - together, we use creative tools to see and feel circumstances differently, enabling each other to act differently. Popular education is a profoundly collaborative theory of learning, and the goal of the learning process is to build capacity from within the group. (If you want to learn more about popular education, here’s a great primer - http://www.practicingfreedom.org/offerings/popular-education/)</p>
  
    <p>My work is also feminist, anti-racist and sex/body-positive, and I work from an anti-oppression lens. That means that I strive to create spaces and systems that are nourishing for people who have been/are historically or currently minoritized and marginalized, spaces which help them to unfurl their own talents and capacities with as much safety as possible. Each space looks different, depending on the specific dynamics at work. It also means that I am very conscious of the influence of violence, colonialism, systemic inequality and shame on our society and thus our social movements; I work to make these impacts visible in our organizations, so that they can be transformed.</p>
  
    <p>Finally—and perhaps most importantly—my work is celebratory, creative and somatic. I believe in the primacy of the body and the need to start there, so I use elements of Body Mind Centering, yoga, dance, breathwork, intuitive movement and somatic awareness in my group-work. Movement helps us see and feel things differently, and it integrates other kinds of intelligence into our problem-solving. I also believe that creative, mind-blowing solutions to problems are necessary, myriad and contained within the problems themselves; eliciting creativity is a big part of what I do.</p>
  
    <p>Ultimately, I believe that every act of change is both an act of risk and an act of faith, and therefore something to be celebrated. And, as many people around the world know, celebration is a way to build accountability, joy and resilience into our communities and relationships, so I always build in ways to celebrate how far we have come and how far we are going. Music, good food, dance, boardgames and all kinds of fun are in order! (Maybe it’s just me with the boardgames but you get what I mean.)</p>
  
    <p>(More on somatics here, on creativity and on the need to celebrate.)</p>
  
  

  <h2>Background</h2>
  
    <p>I have over a decade of experience in community development, social enterprise and cooperative/collective organizing. My work has focused on feminist sexual health, migrant support and justice, fair housing and community wellbeing. Like most people working in social justice movements, my choice to become involved was a gut-level, intuitive one. I believe in social inclusion and in justice, and the disregard for these principles in our society made me angry, so I became an activist.</p>
  
    <p>Over the years, that approach became more and more dysfunctional. I became one of the many burned-out, heartbroken and disassociated political activists - and, for all of my exhaustion and disillusionment, I hadn't even accomplished any of my alleged aims! In my desperation, I began to question the strategies, attitudes and norms of the nonprofit sector and political activism. Clearly there was a big disjuncture between the ways and the means being employed - I knew that toxic organisations, burn out and exhaustion weren't going to build the world we want. I felt, intuitively, that there were other ways, but I didn't know what they were or where to find them.</p>
  
    <p>What I was searching for - and what many of us search for - was different ways of organising, ways that affirmed wellness and resiliency, ways that were creative and healthy, ways that celebrated difference, shared resources and built joy in us even as we confronted the violent and painful parts of our world. I didn't want to have to choose between my own wellbeing and the wellbeing of my community, because I don't think those are separate things. I wanted ways of organizing that came out of indigenous and of colour feminism; out of crip theory and the disability justice movement; out of working-class and undocumented people's experiences. I wanted a movement that nourished and built up its participants, instead of draining them and burning them out. I wanted group collaboration that felt good in my body, in my relationships and in my community. I decided to devote my time and energy to learning about and building systems where these values can take root.</p>
  
    <p>This is what lead me to the work I now do - helping groups and organizations imagine and design practices, systems and cultures that promote wellness, cooperation, creativity and resiliency.</p>
  
    <p>Because I am not alone in wanting these things, I have had the great privilege of being community-educated and learning from a lot of rad people and organisations. You can see a list of them here.</p>
  
    <p>If you want to know about specific projects I've been a part of and ways in which I've been trained, you can see a detailed CV here.</p>
  
  

  <h2>Lineage</h2>
  
    <p>The world is full of brilliant, compassionate and creative people and groups doing amazing work under difficult circumstances. I’ve had the privilege of working with and learning from some of them; others have kindly made their work available in print or online and I’ve benefitted from that, too. Here are some of my favourites…</p>
