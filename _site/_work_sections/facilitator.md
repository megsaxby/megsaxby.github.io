title: Facilitator
paragraphs:
  - As a facilitator and mediator, I help people, groups and organizations have complex or difficult conversations. Most social sector organizations and groups are overwhelmed with Things To Do, and it can be easy to get lost and panicked; an external facilitator, I help groups prioritize, discuss, stay on track and stay accountable. Having an external facilitator also helps your group to ‘zoom out’ and see what large issues are gumming up the works, and together we can develop organizational solutions to address these problems.
  - As a mediator, I help people in conflict discuss the issues at hand and together we come up with a plan of action to transform the conflict/relationship.
