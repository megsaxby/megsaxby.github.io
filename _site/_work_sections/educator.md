paragraphs:
  - I offer one-off and on-going workshops for both adults and young people. Each session is built for the specific group - you tell me what you are interested in learning about, and I develop content for you to choose from. I specialize in sex and relationships education and education for collective process.
  - We use creative and arts-based methods, movement and bodywork, collective discussion, critical reflection and popular education techniques to expand you or your groupâ€™s knowledge and to enable more engaged, thoughtful and creative action. My goal as an educator is that all members of the group leave the space feeling energized by their new knowledge, empowered to act and able to do something that they could not previously do.
