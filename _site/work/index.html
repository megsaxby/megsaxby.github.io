    <h1>What I offer</h1>
    
  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="Educator">Educator</h2>
    
      <p>I offer one-off and on-going workshops for both adults and young people. Each session is built for the specific group - you tell me what you are interested in learning about, and I develop content for you to choose from. I specialize in sex and relationships education and education for collective process.</p>
    
      <p>We use creative and arts-based methods, movement and bodywork, collective discussion, critical reflection and popular education techniques to expand you or your group’s knowledge and to enable more engaged, thoughtful and creative action. My goal as an educator is that all members of the group leave the space feeling energized by their new knowledge, empowered to act and able to do something that they could not previously do.</p>
    
    
      <ul>
        <h3>Topics include:</h3>
        
          <li>- Sex Positivity in Practice - Building Healthy Relationships, Organisations and Cultures</li>
        
          <li>- My Body, My Choices - Sex Positivity for Teens</li>
        
          <li>- Discovering, Embodying and Communicating Your Boundaries (Women and Trans* only)</li>
        
          <li>- Speak Up - Tools for Communication in Relationships and Organisations</li>
        
          <li>- Self-Care and Community-Care - Building A Practice</li>
        
          <li>- Going Round In Circles? Tools for Discussion, Collective Decision Making and Conflict</li>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="Facilitator">Facilitator</h2>
    
      <p>As a facilitator and mediator, I help people, groups and organizations have complex or difficult conversations. Most social sector organizations and groups are overwhelmed with Things To Do, and it can be easy to get lost and panicked; an external facilitator, I help groups prioritize, discuss, stay on track and stay accountable. Having an external facilitator also helps your group to ‘zoom out’ and see what large issues are gumming up the works, and together we can develop organizational solutions to address these problems.</p>
    
      <p>As a mediator, I help people in conflict discuss the issues at hand and together we come up with a plan of action to transform the conflict/relationship.</p>
    
    
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 id="Organiser">Organiser</h2>
    
      <p>I work with collectives, cooperatives, social sector groups and organisations to help design better, more efficient and more healthy collaboration. Your group explains to me where and how you feel stuck, and then, together, we design systems and practices that work better for your goals. I aim to help you create systems that promote a culture of wellness, cooperation, creativity and resiliency in your organization.</p>
    
      <p>My approach is somatic, collaborative and inclusive—you can read more about what that means here. In sessions, we will use body and movement-based techniques, creative discussion, arts and play, accessible group dialogue and visual tools to re-imagine and re-design the areas that are not working.</p>
    
      <p>As an organizer, my goal is that you and your group leave with new ways to get where you are going.</p>
