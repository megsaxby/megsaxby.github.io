title: Approach
paragraphs:
  - Philosophically and practically, I come out of the popular education movement. This means that all of my work is based on the principles of reflection and action - together, we use creative tools to see and feel circumstances differently, enabling each other to act differently. Popular education is a profoundly collaborative theory of learning, and the goal of the learning process is to build capacity from within the group. (If you want to learn more about popular education, here’s a great primer - http://www.practicingfreedom.org/offerings/popular-education/)
  - My work is also feminist, anti-racist and sex/body-positive, and I work from an anti-oppression lens. That means that I strive to create spaces and systems that are nourishing for people who have been/are historically or currently minoritized and marginalized, spaces which help them to unfurl their own talents and capacities with as much safety as possible. Each space looks different, depending on the specific dynamics at work. It also means that I am very conscious of the influence of violence, colonialism, systemic inequality and shame on our society and thus our social movements; I work to make these impacts visible in our organizations, so that they can be transformed.
  - Finally—and perhaps most importantly—my work is celebratory, creative and somatic. I believe in the primacy of the body and the need to start there, so I use elements of Body Mind Centering, yoga, dance, breathwork, intuitive movement and somatic awareness in my group-work. Movement helps us see and feel things differently, and it integrates other kinds of intelligence into our problem-solving. I also believe that creative, mind-blowing solutions to problems are necessary, myriad and contained within the problems themselves; eliciting creativity is a big part of what I do.
  - Ultimately, I believe that every act of change is both an act of risk and an act of faith, and therefore something to be celebrated. And, as many people around the world know, celebration is a way to build accountability, joy and resilience into our communities and relationships, so I always build in ways to celebrate how far we have come and how far we are going. Music, good food, dance, boardgames and all kinds of fun are in order! (Maybe it’s just me with the boardgames but you get what I mean.)
